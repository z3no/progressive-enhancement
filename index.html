            <h2>The Story</h2>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,&nbsp;
                    <q class="neighbours">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>&nbsp;
                    The farmer said,&nbsp;
                    <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>&nbsp;
                    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,&nbsp;
                    <q class="neighbours">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>&nbsp;
                    The farmer again said,&nbsp;
                    <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,&nbsp;
                    <q class="neighbours">Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,</q>&nbsp;
                    and the farmer responded,&nbsp;
                    <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>&nbsp;
                    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,&nbsp;
                    <q class="neighbours">Isn’t that great!</q>&nbsp;
                    Again, he said,&nbsp;
                    <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.
                </p>

                <tr>
                    <td>Avoid war</td>
                    <td>Maybe</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are <em class="bad">not good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
